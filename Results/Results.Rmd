## Introduction

This research questions was how tall people are and the sample was the ASDS class. 

## Data

Import here the data and describe it. Include in the chunk below a brief summary

```{r data, echo = FALSE}
# copy paste the code to import the data
data <- read_csv(Data_height.csv)

```

## Analysis

We've created different functions to understand and calculate the difference between the standard population, sample and distributions. 

```{r data visualisation, echo = FALSE}
##Standard deviation calculation 
(sd_pop <- sqrt(
  sum(
    (data$height - mean(data$height))^2)
  /length(data$height))) 

(sd_samp <- sd(data$height)) 

sd_pop == sd_samp 
```

## Conclusion

Weakness: a lot of code
